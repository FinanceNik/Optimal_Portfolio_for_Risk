**Important instructions before being able to start the application**

A couple of steps have to be followed in order to get the application started.

---
Prerequisites:
```
- Have Python 3 installed, preferably Python 3.9
    - checkable in the terminal via:
    
        python3 --version
        
- Have the package manager PIP installed
    - usually, automatically installed with Python
    - checkable in the terminal via:
    
        pip --version
```

After fulfilling the prerequisites, one can start to install the dependencies
and run the application:

```
1. Install the required dependecies:
    - open the terminal in the folder in which the Python modules are located
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
2. Run the GUI_TOOL module
    - either in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Pycharm, VSCode...
    - or via the terminal
    
        python3 GUI_TOOL.py
        
3. A terminal output should be displayed with the link on which port the application
   is running, however, typically should be:
   
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/

4. Copy the address and paste it into your desired browser. 
```

**You should now find yourself on the _Welcome_ page of the application.**
